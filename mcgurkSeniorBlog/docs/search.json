I will work diligently and give you a fair result.\r\nJust, please, for the love of all the is holy, pay me more than my voice acting directors.\r\nMore (serious and professional) posts to come. I am really just figuring this out for now.\r\nWhat I am doing\r\nI am creating a machine learning algorithm to determine which leads turn into customers for the solar company I work for. I am using data about each leadsâ€™ location, talk numbers, number of appointments, etc to determine which leads will turn into customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
