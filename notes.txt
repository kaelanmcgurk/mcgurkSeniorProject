Time I have spent on this project:
Feb 5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-24

(Updated on 3/5/21)
Hours: ~70

Basic premise of what I have been working on for each day
5th; Think about what metrics I want to have in my algorithm. Which stats would BEST tell me which leads become customers

8th-10th; Read in the initial dataset. Look through it and see that it is AWFUL (big shock I know) do my best to clean it, 
    get rid of unnecessary data, or somehow change it to be more accurate to the column it is in (I don't believe there is a zip code
    called 'poasoejfpo','????', or 'hotmail.com')

11th-12th; Once the data is in a good enough spot to be worked with, start making the very first machine learning algorithm. Start with
    descision tree and go from there. Change some things in the data set or how I feed the data into the algorithm. Try an XKBoost
    next.

15th-17th; Feel confident that the model I made can accurately predict which leads turn into customers. Fail. Get stopped immedieatly
    by how starkly different the data is from the testing data. Feel bad about myself. 

18th-19th, 22-24th; Feel better about myself because my manager wants me to get some different numbers aobut leads and reps. Think
    about how I can use these new numbers to better my old algorithms. Start working on getting the 'Speed to Contact' numbers and
    the 'Time to Appointment' numbers. Use those for the main work project AND my new machine learning algorithms.
