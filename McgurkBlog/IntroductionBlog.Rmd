Hello! My name is Kaelan McGurk. I am an aspiring data scientist with an affinity for answering questions. I like digging into the raw data and coming up with solutions. I will work diligently and give you a fair result.

Just, please, for the love of all the is holy, pay me more than my voice acting directors.

More (serious and professional) posts to come. I am really just figuring this out for now. 

# What I am doing

I am creating a machine learning algorithm to determine which leads turn into customers for the solar company I work for. I am using data about each leads' location, talk numbers, number of appointments, etc to determine which leads will turn into customers.
